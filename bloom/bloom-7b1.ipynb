However, she took bigger steps and we had a relationship that full of gaslighting and full of her imbalances. We broke up 2 times during that 2 months and she did not tell me anything further, she just always said she is afraid of connecting to someone but she wanted me too. It was too late because I was already connected to her with all my heart and feelings. We slept, we shared so many things together but in the end, she said she does not want to be with me anymore. She just wanted to stay friends. She said she never loved me, never trusted me, never value me since the beginning of our relationship. She said when she does sth with me, she felt always like she is betraying his ex (who was broke up with her 1.5 years ago) That hurt so bad because you know that even tho when you felt so wonderful emotions and felt so happy with her, built your future with her in your mind. Then all of them vanished suddenly. Rather than breaking up, her words hurt me so much. She never looked like that kind of. She\\'s been enjoying it as well from my view. I did not want to be friend of her cuz I know that that will torture me inside if I stay close to her still. It\\'s been 1 week but I don\\'t know what to do. Every day I see her.

I’ve been taking intermittent HCG tests and today it was finally negative.  Really looking forward to switching back to TTC but also terrified this will happen again after losing two pregnancies since October. Hugs to all wherever you are in the process. \\nObserver:\\nGoing through multiple pregnancies losses is so tough. It makes it really hard to keep going because everything is filled with anxiety that something will just go wrong again. It\\'s great that you are almost back to ttc. We are waiting a bit longer for some more rpl testing since we have had 3 losses now. It\\'s rough because I am impatient but it also gives me a break from the anxiety and dread of another positive and loss. I hope we can find something to do to give us better odds next time.

It was too late because I was already connected to her with all my heart and feelings. We slept, we shared so many things together but in the end, she said she does not want to be with me anymore.

I’ve been taking intermittent HCG tests and today it was finally negative.

Hugs to all wherever you are in the process. \\nObserver:\\nGoing through multiple pregnancies losses is so tough. It makes it really hard to keep going because everything is filled with anxiety that something will just go wrong again. It\\'s great that you are almost back to ttc. We are waiting a bit longer for some more rpl testing since we have had 3 losses now. It\\'s rough because I am impatient but it also gives me a break from the anxiety and dread of another positive and loss. I hope we can find something to do to give us better odds next time.

It was too late because I was already connected to her with all my heart and feelings. We slept, we shared so many things together but in the end, she said she does not want to be with me anymore. She just wanted to stay friends. She said she never loved me, never trusted me, never value me since the beginning of our relationship.

I’ve been taking intermittent HCG tests and today it was finally negative.  Really looking forward to switching back to TTC but also terrified this will happen again after losing two pregnancies since October. Hugs to all wherever you are in the process. \\nObserver:\\nGoing through multiple pregnancies losses is so tough. It makes it really hard to keep going because everything is filled with anxiety that something will just go wrong again. It\\'s great that you are almost back to ttc.

It\\'s rough because I am impatient but it also gives me a break from the anxiety and dread of another positive and loss. I hope we can find something to do to give us better odds next time.

We broke up 2 times during that 2 months and she did not tell me anything further, she just always said she is afraid of connecting to someone but she wanted me too. It was too late because I was already connected to her with all my heart and feelings. We slept, we shared so many things together but in the end, she said she does not want to be with me anymore. She just wanted to stay friends. She said she never loved me, never trusted me, never value me since the beginning of our relationship. She said when she does sth with me, she felt always like she is betraying his ex (who was broke up with her 1.5 years ago) That hurt so bad because you know that even tho when you felt so wonderful emotions and felt so happy with her, built your future with her in your mind. Then all of them vanished suddenly. Rather than breaking up, her words hurt me so much. She never looked like that kind of. She\\'s been enjoying it as well from my view. I did not want to be friend of her cuz I know that that will torture me inside if I stay close to her still. It\\'s been 1 week but I don\\'t know what to do. Every day I see her. Every night I check my phone if she texts me or calls me to say that she fixed herself and ready to be with me again. I am so desperate and it sucks. I don\\'t know what to do.\\nObserver:\\nJust be desperate but a part. I know the agony, the defeat, the questions. I know that you felt like you were going crazy. That you were willing to sacrifice anything and everything for them. I know the anxiety that builds thinking that you\\'ve lost someone who is still walking around on this planet, but is, for all intensive purposes, dead to you as you are to them. Given what you wrote, I would say start the grieving process and just assume that it\\'s over for good. It\\'s the only thing you can do to truly heal. Waiting for her to change or assuming that she will, will only make it worse. Do what\\'s right for you, not for her. She\\'s established that she needs to do things on her own now. Allow her to do that. Allow yourself the freedom to do that too. I know what I\\'m saying is hard. I wrestle with it every minute of the day too. But what I\\'m saying here has been what I\\'ve told myself everyday.

appointment is Friday hopefully we get the all clear to resume normal activities and to start TTC again. Admittedly we had sex last weekend (8 days post) which probably wasn’t the best idea since I’m supposed to be on pelvic rest but it happened and it is what it is. I’ve been taking intermittent HCG tests and today it was finally negative.  Really looking forward to switching back to TTC but also terrified this will happen again after losing two pregnancies since October. Hugs to all wherever you are in the process. \\nObserver:\\nGoing through multiple pregnancies losses is so tough. It makes it really hard to keep going because everything is filled with anxiety that something will just go wrong again. It\\'s great that you are almost back to ttc. We are waiting a bit longer for some more rpl testing since we have had 3 losses now. It\\'s rough because I am impatient but it also gives me a break from the anxiety and dread of another positive and loss. I hope we can find something to do to give us better odds next time. This journey is so rough.\\nThe span \"This journey is so rough.\" from Observer is predicted to have label '], 'predictions': []}}\n"

    "## Description:\n",
    "Example on running very large models like OPT-66B, OPT-175B, BLOOM-176B on the cluster on a single 6-8 GPUs node, in INT8, fp16 or fp32 mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "Install the following. Transformers needs to be the beta version, from the git repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install accelerate\n",
    "pip install deepspeed\n",
    "pip install bitsandbytes\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can change the `MODEL_NAME`. It is the HuggingFace model name.\n",
    "- Set `USE_8BIT` to `False` if you don't want to use 8-bit mode. \n",
    "- Set `DTYPE_NOT_8BIT` to `torch.fp32` if you want to use fp16 (and you're not in 8-bit mode).\n",
    "- `MAX_MEMORY_GB` is very important. It's the max memory to use to *load* the model per GPU. If you don't set a limit, HuggingFace will fill up the first GPUs and not use the rest, and the first GPUs will blow up when you try to run the model.\n",
    "- 32-bit mode required an `OFFLOAD_FOLDER` to be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we tested:\n",
    "We only tested on 6xA100 40GB GPUs. Here's what works. Only tested inference for all of these.\n",
    "- BLOOM 176B works on INT8 mode only.\n",
    "- OPT 66B works on INT8 and fp16 mode, but not fp32.\n",
    "\n",
